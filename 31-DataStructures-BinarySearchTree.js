//Binary Tree
//A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children.
//They are referred as left child and right child.

//Binary Search Tree
//The value of each left node must be smaller than the parent node.
//The value of each right node must be greater than the parent node.
//Each node has at most two children.

//Binary Search Tree Operations:
//1. Insertion - To add a node to the tree
//2. Search - To find a node given its value
//3. DFS(Depth Frist Seach) & BFS(Breadth Fist Search) - To visit all nodes in a tree.
//4. Deletion - To remove a node given its value.
