//Graph
//A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a finite number of vertices(nodes) connected by edges
//Trees are a specific type of graph data structures.

//Types of graphs
//1. Directed
//A graph in which the edges have a direction.
//Edges are usually represented as arrows pointing in the direction the graph can be traversed.
//A->B->C

//2. Undirected
//A graph in which the edges are bidirectional.
//The graph can be traversed in either direction.
//The absence of arrows tells us the graph is undirected.
//A-B-C or C-B-A

//More types of graphs.
//1. Only vortices(nodes) - NO EDGES
//2. Multiple edges from one node
//3. Cycles in the graph
//4. Self Loops on a node
//5. Disconnected nodes
//6. A graph may contain weighs on the egdes, representing the cost of traversing the edge.

//Graph Usage
//Google Maps - Navigation Apps
